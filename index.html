        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>
            3pounds fresh plum tomatoes, blanched, peeled, seeded and quartered, 3ounces olive oil, Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste, 1 pinch crushed red-pepper flakes1pound dry spaghetti2ounces</p>
        <h4>Preparations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the tomatoes crosswise. Set aside in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat 3 ounces olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until it smokes slightly. Add tomatoes, salt, pepper and crushed red pepper.</li>
            <li>Chop the tomatoes with a potato masher until they are in fine chunks and all their liquid is released. Be sure they are chopped and crushed fine, for a semichunky sauce. Simmer for 25 minutes over medium heat.</li>
            <li>While the sauce simmers, heat the water for the pasta. Cook the spaghetti in salted water about half of the way cooked. Drain, reserving some of the water.</li>
            <!--
            <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Add the pasta to the sauce and cook over medium-high heat until all the liquid is absorbed and the pasta is al dente. If the sauce is over-reduced, use the pasta cooking liquid to adjust it.</li>
            <li>At the last moment, remove the pan from the heat; add the extra-virgin olive oil, butter, basil and cheese. Mix thoroughly until the pasta is an orangy color. Taste again and adjust the salt if necessary. Remove to a platter. Serve.</li>
